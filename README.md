# PokerTheory
A simple library of playing card check

This is my old project, wrote at serveral years ago.<br/>
At that time I work in a game company which make many poker game, I write library many time, again and again if sometime I feel not satisfied, and this is most final version<br/>
(Maybe I will make some change, this style is my past style, modify to more morden if i am have some time)<br/>
<br/>
This library is suit to teach junior about programming skill. <br/>

<br/>
it is nice if you just need a library to use, but it is not easy to read, especially the one on codeproject<br/>
<br/>
I think nice code should be:<br/>
- clean (less useless code)<br/>
- readable (use meaningful words and leave comment)<br/>
- functions (extract into many simple, dont a big function do everything)<br/>

And last thing is perfermance, if coding a simple, perfermance is high
